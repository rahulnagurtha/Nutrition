# What are nutrients?

Chemical substances present in food that are used by the bodily functions including metabolism, growth, reproduction, development and tissu repair and maintain health. 

| Nutrient Type | Examples | Consumption Amount |
|---|---|---|
| **Macronutrients** | Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats, Water | Eaten in large amounts (grams) |
| **Micronutrients** | Vitamins, Minerals | Eaten in small amounts (mg or micrograms) |

Divided into 2 types.

## Macro nutrients
Taken in large quantities usually in grams. 4 types namely water, carbohydrates, proteins, fats.

| Macronutrient | Carbohydrate | Protein | Fat | Water |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Energy Content** | 4 kcal/g | 4 kcal/g | 9 kcal/g | 0 kcal/g |
| **Roles in body structure** | Part of connective tissue, stored in the liver and muscle as glycogen | Part of every cell and tissue in our body, particularly skeletal muscle | Part of cell membranes, fat stores are a source of energy and provide insulation and protection | Blood volume, in and around every cell |
| **Roles in bodily functions** | Primary source of energy for brain and red blood cells | Chemical reactions in metabolism, proteins in blood maintain blood volume | Synthesis of hormones and Vitamin D | Urine for excretion, metabolic reactions, body temperature |

## Micro nutrients
Taken in small quantities usually in milli grams or micro grams. 2 types namely vitamins and minerals.


|   | **Vitamins** |   | **Minerals** |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   | **Water-Soluble** | **Fat Soluble** | **Major Minerals** | **Trace Elements** |
|   | Choline | Vitamin A | Calcium | Chromium |
|   | Folate | Vitamin D | Chloride | Copper | 
|   | Niacin | Vitamin E | Magnesium | Fluoride |
|   | Pantothenic Acid | Vitamin K | Phosphorus | Iodine | 
|   | Riboflavin |  | Potassium | Iron |
|   | Thiamin |  | Sodium | Manganese |
|   | Vitamin B6 |  | Sulfur | Molybdenum |
|   | Vitamin B12 |  |  | Selenium | 
|   | Vitamin C |  |  | Zinc | 
| **Roles in bodily functions:** | • Chemical Reactions, Body Structure, Hormones |   | **Roles in bodily functions:** | • Body structure<br>• Work with proteins in chemical reactions<br>• Nerve transduction and muscle contraction |

# Carbohydrates

* Composed of C, H, O
* Body's Main Energy Source. There are main types of carbohydrates:
    * **Sugar**
    	* Lactose (found in dairy products)
    	* Fructose (Found in druits)
    	* Sucrose (Table sugar).  
    * **Starch**: Starch is many sucrose bonded together. This is found mainly in vegatables, beans, grains etc.
    * **Fiber**: Fiber is also a complex structure like Starch but its different in a way that it can't be broken down by our body.
* Recommended Intake: 45 to 65% of Total Daily Calories.

Some carbs are healthier than others, its better to avoid refined foods with sugars and rather opt for fibers, whole grains and beans.



# Proteins

* Composed of C, H, O, and N
* Building Blocks of Body
* 20 Amino Acids (9 Essential)
    * Animal Proteins: Contains ALL essential acids and hence called **complete proteins**. Examples include dairy, meat and eggs.
    * Plant Proteins: Except Soy, others miss some essential acids and hence called **incomplete proteins**. Examples include beans, soy, nuts and some grains. You can combine these with others to make it complete protein, for example you can combine rice and beans.
* Recommended Intake: 20 to 35% of Total Daily Calories

# Fats 

* Composed of C, H, and O 
* Metabolized to H2O and CO
* Types:
    * Saturated (Solid): Butter etc
    * Unsaturated (Oils): Oil etc
* Essential Fatty Acids:
    * Linoleic Acid (omega-6): Found in safflower, soybean, corn, and canola oils, as well as nuts and seeds.
    * α-linolenic acid (omega-3): Found in seafood, flaxseed oil, chia seeds, hemp seeds, and canola oil.
* Recommended Intake: 20 to 35% of Total Daily Calories

# Water

* 62% of Body Weight is Water
* Shock Absorber
* Carry Nutrients to Cells
* Hydrate the Body
* Recommended Daily Intake:
    * Women: 11.5 Cups/90 Ounces or 2.7 Liters
    * Men: 15.5 Cups/124 Ounces or 3.7 Liters
* About 80% should come from liquids and 20% from fruits and vegetables


# Vitamins

Vitamins are crucial for maintaining good health and warding off diseases. There are a total of 13 essential vitamins, which are classified into two categories:

* **Fat Soluble Vitamins:** These vitamins are stored in our body fat.
* **Water Soluble Vitamins:** These vitamins are not stored in the body and any excess is excreted through urine.


Vitamins play a multitude of roles in our body, including:

* Supporting healthy vision
* Maintaining skin health
* Promoting strong bones


The best way to get your daily dose of vitamins is through a diverse and balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables.

##### Vitamin Supplements

If you consider taking vitamin supplements:

* Opt for supplements that provide no more than 100% of the recommended daily intake.
* Be cautious with fat-soluble vitamins as taking high doses through supplements can lead to toxicity.


# Minerals

Minerals, similar to vitamins, are crucial for supporting various bodily functions, including:

* Building strong bones and teeth
* Regulating metabolism
* Maintaining proper hydration


To ensure you're getting all the necessary minerals:

* Aim for a diverse diet that includes both plant-based and animal-based foods.
* Consider taking iron or calcium supplements if needed.


# Nutrient Density

Nutrient density refers to the amount of nutrients (such as vitamins, minerals, and fiber) provided by a food in relation to its calorie content. In other words, it measures the nutritional value of a food per unit of energy it provides. Choosing foods that are nutrient-dense should be a priority to meet our nutrient needs. Foods higher in fat, sodium, and added sugar tend to have lower nutrient density. 


Nutrient-dense foods are vital for a healthy diet because they:

* Meet nutrient needs: Provide essential vitamins and minerals for optimal body function.
* Promote optimal health: Support the immune system, bone and muscle health, and overall well-being.
* Aid weight management: Tend to be lower in calories, promoting satiety and reducing overeating.
* Prevent diseases: Lower the risk of chronic diseases due to their antioxidants and phytochemicals.
