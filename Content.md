# What are nutrients?

Chemical substances present in food that are used by the bodily functions including metabolism, growth, reproduction, development and tissu repair and maintain health. 

| Nutrient Type | Examples | Consumption Amount |
|---|---|---|
| **Macronutrients** | Carbohydrates, Proteins, Fats, Water | Eaten in large amounts (grams) |
| **Micronutrients** | Vitamins, Minerals | Eaten in small amounts (mg or micrograms) |

Divided into 2 types.

## Macro nutrients
Taken in large quantities usually in grams. 4 types namely water, carbohydrates, proteins, fats.

| Macronutrient | Carbohydrate | Protein | Fat | Water |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Energy Content** | 4 kcal/g | 4 kcal/g | 9 kcal/g | 0 kcal/g |
| **Roles in body structure** | Part of connective tissue, stored in the liver and muscle as glycogen | Part of every cell and tissue in our body, particularly skeletal muscle | Part of cell membranes, fat stores are a source of energy and provide insulation and protection | Blood volume, in and around every cell |
| **Roles in bodily functions** | Primary source of energy for brain and red blood cells | Chemical reactions in metabolism, proteins in blood maintain blood volume | Synthesis of hormones and Vitamin D | Urine for excretion, metabolic reactions, body temperature |

## Micro nutrients
Taken in small quantities usually in milli grams or micro grams. 2 types namely vitamins and minerals.


|   | **Vitamins** |   | **Minerals** |   |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|   | **Water-Soluble** | **Fat Soluble** | **Major Minerals** | **Trace Elements** |
|   | Choline | Vitamin A | Calcium | Chromium |
|   | Folate | Vitamin D | Chloride | Copper | 
|   | Niacin | Vitamin E | Magnesium | Fluoride |
|   | Pantothenic Acid | Vitamin K | Phosphorus | Iodine | 
|   | Riboflavin |  | Potassium | Iron |
|   | Thiamin |  | Sodium | Manganese |
|   | Vitamin B6 |  | Sulfur | Molybdenum |
|   | Vitamin B12 |  |  | Selenium | 
|   | Vitamin C |  |  | Zinc | 
| **Roles in bodily functions:** | • Chemical Reactions, Body Structure, Hormones |   | **Roles in bodily functions:** | • Body structure<br>• Work with proteins in chemical reactions<br>• Nerve transduction and muscle contraction |
